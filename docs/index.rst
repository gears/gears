Gears
=====

Gears is a library to compile, concatenate and minify JavaScript and CSS
assets, highly inspired by Ruby's Sprockets_. You can also write scripts,
styles and client templates using CoffeeScript_, Handlebars_, Stylus_, Less_,
and compile them using external packages (gears-coffeescript_,
gears-handlebars_, gears-stylus_, gears-less_). These packages already include
all required node.js modules, so you don't need to worry about installing them
yourself.

There is also:

- django-gears_, an app for Django that integrates Gears with Django project;
- Flask-Gears_, an extension that integrates Gears with Flask application;
- gears-cli_, a command-line utility that compiles assets. It also can watch
  assets for changes and automaticaly re-compile them.
